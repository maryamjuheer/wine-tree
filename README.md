# wine-tree

The code I used for one of my first year assignments. Wine is classified according to the specified classes, the data is then visualised as a decision tree, and a classification accuracy is printed. 

Taken from the assignment's specification:<br>
"The data is the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the same region in Italy by three different cultivators. There 
are thirteen different measurements taken for different constituents found in the three types of wine, class_0, class_1, and class_2. Those thirteen different measurements include: Alcohol, Malic acid, Ash, Alcalinity of ash, Magnesium, Total phenols, Flavanoids, Nonflavanoid phenols, Proanthocyanins, Color intensity, Hue, OD280/OD315 of diluted wines and Proline."
